Ebook converter
===============

This is impudent ripoff of the bits from `Calibre project`_, and is aimed only
for converter thing.

My motivation is to have only converter for ebooks run from commandline,
without all of those bells and whistles Calibre have, and with cleanest more
*pythonic* approach.
